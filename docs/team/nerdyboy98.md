### Project: TrAcker

TrAcker is a desktop app for CS2040 Teaching Assistants (TA) to centralise the
CS2040 tasks involving them. It is optimised for use via a Command Line
Interface (CLI) while still having benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you
can type fast, TrAcker will display all the tutorials, labs and consultations in a specific
time frame. You will also be able to visualise your schedule in a calendar format.
Students involved in an event will be displayed based on preference.


Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to sort recurring events.
  * What it does: Allows the TA to sort the recurring events available in the order specified.
  * Justification: This feature helps the TA to find their desired event faster, improving his/her work efficiency.
  * Highlights: Sorting methods are available in either Alphabetical, Date or Duration. With each sorting method, the TA can also choose top down or bottom up order as well.

* **New Feature**: Added the function to provide help to new TA(s) using the application
  * What it does: Returns a list of instructions on what the event encompasses and also what parameters and input format is required to successfully create said event.
  * Justification: Helps the new TA to understand the syntax to be used and reduces the need to memories them or refer to external documentations.
  * Highlights: New TA can specify the help they need (e.g. lab, tutorial, consultation) so that not everything is displayed and the TA will then have to scroll through to find their desired help.
